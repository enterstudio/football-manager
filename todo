Todo:
- proper forms with validations... etc.
- tests !
- player editor
- loading indicator
- svg icon does not work in github pages
- add snackbar

Done:
- delete button : rounded x would be better - NOT looking better, keep the original action buttons
- prebuilt material theme colors are so ugly, create a custom colored theme
- date picker? material2 does not provide any date picker (yet?)
- player position, proper selection
